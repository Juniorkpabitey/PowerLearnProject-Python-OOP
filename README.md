# Python OOP Assignment: Person Class

## Overview
This Python project defines a class named `Person` to represent individuals. The `Person` class has attributes for name, age, and gender, along with a method to introduce the person by printing their information. An instance of the `Person` class is created, and the `introduce` method is called to display the person's information.

## Class: Person
- **Attributes:**
  - `name`: representing the person's name.
  - `age`: representing the person's age.
  - `gender`: representing the person's gender.
- **Methods:**
  - `introduce()`: prints a message introducing the person with their name, age, and gender.

## Usage
1. Define a `Person` object by providing values for `name`, `age`, and `gender`.
2. Call the `introduce()` method on the `Person` object to display the person's information.

Example:
```python
# Define a Person object
person1 = Person("John", 30, "male")

# Display the person's information
person1.introduce()
```
